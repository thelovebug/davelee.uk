# Goals
I suppose my first goal would be keeping this - and my [/now](https://davelee.uk/now) page up to date! üòÅ

## Hobbies
I have a number of hobbies that I don't really spend as much time on as I should:

#### Amateur Radio 
* My antenna is currently down, so that needs putting up again.
* I recently won a weather station from Moonraker, so that needs putting up.
* I have a Flight Tracker machine, that has an antenna that's currently in the shack, that needs moving outside somehow.
* I want to go back to my original intent of at least one contact - of any type - in the log per day.

#### 3D Printing
* The printer only comes out when I need to print something.  It'd be nice to get to a stage when the printer is always running.  I know this isn't realistic, but you get what I mean.
* I've been gifted two rolls of filament for Christmas.  Let's get it used! (and buy some more!)

#### Podcasting
* My solo podcast is shockingly inactive.  Fix it.

## Health
* Walk at least 30 minutes a day
* Eat healthier
* Hopefully the first two will help me lose weight.  I'm not going to set an arbitrary weight loss goal.

## Other stuff
* Let's have another go at the Goodreads Book Challenge - 12 books in 2024.

# Achievements
...will appear here when they happen.
