## Goals and Achievements for 2021

### Goals

Based on what I said under 2020 about setting myself up for a fall by setting arbitrary goals, I'm going to set one this year, and that is...

* **Keep in contact with friends and family**
Anyone who knows me is fully aware at how crap I am at keeping in contact with people.  It's nothing personal, it's just me.  So I will make a concerted effort to keep in contact with friends and family.  The measurement of success with this one is if I have friends and family who are still talking to me.

* **Other stuff**
Yes, I've set a target to lose weight, and to read a certain number of books, and finish reading the Bible... all things that I had set as goals last year, but these will appear as Achievements below as an incentive for me to do them.

### Achievements

* will appear here when they happen.

## Goals for 2020 - Result


* **Read the entire Bible by December 31, using [this plan](https://www.bible.com/en-GB/reading-plans/10819-the-one-year-chronological-bible)**
Finished 2020 about seven weeks behind, but I will finish it.

* **Participate in the [Goodreads 2020 Reading Challenge](https://www.goodreads.com/user_challenges/19193879)**
By the end of 2020, I was 93% of the way through my 8th book, meaning I only managed to complete 7 out of the targeted 18.  See 2021.

* **Lose 3 stone by the end of the year**
To be fair, I can't remember what my starting weight was, but I can say with all certainty that this goal did not happen.  That said, we did make a fairly sharp turn in how we manage our food, and the weight is now slowly coming off.

* **Learn the drums to [50 Ways To Leave Your Lover](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/50_Ways_to_Leave_Your_Lover)**
I started with good intentions, but I think I saturated myself with other things.

### Summary

I realised that I've been going about this all wrong.  I'm setting myself arbitrary targets for things that are essentially challenges, therefore setting myself up for a fall if I don't achieve them.  Whereas what I _should_ be doing is celebrating the things that I _have_ achieved over the year, and be happy with that.

### Achievements

* **[The Big Slurp](https://thelovebug.org/slurp)**
I finally started my solo podcast, kicked off with NaPodPoMo - 30 episodes in 30 days.  I haven't done anything else then, but I'm not concerned, as I have two episodes planned and ready to record when I'm ready.
