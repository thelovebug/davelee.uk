From the [OggCamp](https://oggcamp.org/) website:

> OggCamp is an unconference celebrating Free Culture, Free and Open Source Software, hardware hacking, digital rights, and all manner of collaborative cultural activities.

This is the first OggCamp to have taken place for 5 years; the previous one having taken place in 2019.  There was one planned for 2020, but then The Event&trade; happened which put paid to any kind of social gathering of any kind: geek events, pub crawls, you name it; gone.

I went to my first OggCamp in 2014 at the The Oxford Hotel (in Oxford!).  That was an amazing experience for me, meeting people that I'd known online for years; people who were committed geeks like myself.

_Check out the [OggCamp History](https://oggcamp.org/history/) page for a potted journey through the years, although for some reason Sheffield 2018 is missing..._ :thinking:
