## The hypothesis

As I have migrated this site from Ghost to a static site generated by [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) with [GitHub](https://github.com/), I wanted to test the theory that I could update the site on my Galaxy Tab S6 in exactly the same way that I do on my laptop.  So, armed with [Termux](https://termux.dev/) and my trusty tablet (with keyboard) I set about seeing whether I could write this post and publish it from a completely cold start.

## The execution

I'm not going to go into step-by-step detail here, just the basic process.  Now, when I said "cold start" earlier, I meant that Git, Hugo, the GitHub repo with the site on... none of that was already on the tablet.

So, a simple:
```bash
pkg install git gh hugo
```

... followed by the instructions I posted over at [thelovebug/davelee.uk](https://github.com/thelovebug/davelee.uk/) to grab the repo and the theme submodule, and I'm seemingly ready to go.

I even ran:
```bash
hugo server -D --disableFastRender
```

... just to see if I could load the site locally for testing purposes, and whaddyaknow, it actually works!

So, I'm typing this post in `nano` in Termux, and I have already downloaded an image to go with the post.  So, as of this moment, this particular experiment has all the hallmark of a potential success.

## The result

This is weird, because this next section is fully dependent on whether this next section works or not.  I'm writing this in the tone of someone who already assumes that the experiment has been a success.  This is essentially [Schr√∂dinger's blog post](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schr%C3%B6dinger%27s_cat).  _(yes, I know that's not strictly true, but what's a blog post without a good heavy dose of misrepresentation, huh?)_

So, after testing the site works with a `hugo server` command, and loading up the site locally, and then correcting all of the typos that are undoubtedly present in the post, I have done:

```bash
git add .
git status
git commit -m "New post 'an-experiment'"
git push
```

... so a few seconds or minutes later, this post is now live on the site.

See, as I write this -  having not yet carried out this bit - I am full of confidence!
