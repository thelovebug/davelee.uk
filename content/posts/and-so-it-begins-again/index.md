A little over a year ago, I started a new blog under this domain with intent to make it my professional site.

"Great idea", I hear you shout (wearily).  Well, it would have been had I not tried to build the site using an ideal that I simply didn't have time to pursue.  Don't get me wrong, [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) is a fantastic piece of kit and - given the time - I would love to have progressed with it but - given my propensity to procrastination - a lower barrier to entry is better for me.

Besides, listening to a talk that [@jamietanna](https://twitter.com/jamietanna) made at [OggCamp](https://oggcamp.org/) last weekend, I realised that I didn't have to make hosting a website a complex process.  Yeah, [WordPress](https://wordpress.org) would do the job, but that's a huge hammer for something that will essentially be a collection of articles and blog posts that will remain static for the most part.

That's why I went with [Ghost](https://ghost.org/).  It's free ([in both senses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gratis_versus_libre)), self-hosted ([IndieWeb](https://indieweb.org/)), and comparatively faff-free.  Win!  With an editor system somewhat (and spookily) similar to that of the new WordPress block editor, and native support of Markdown, well I should be able to just Blog&Go&trade;

Let's see.

The site is a bit out-of-the-box at the moment: I will make some changes, but nothing drastic.  I'll just keep the basic theme, as it works well.
