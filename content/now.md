## Transient stuff

* **Still studying for my [Intermediate Amateur Radio license](https://www.oarc.uk/intermediate)**
Having achieved my Foundation license in April, it seemed logical to progress to Intermediate.  Find me on [QRZ (M7TLB)](https://qrz.com/db/M7TLB)
* Learning about the JS8, PSK31, and RTTY data modes on Amateur Radio

## Professionally

* **Career shift**
In a new role looking after Application Security and Environments in my business unit.  This is very new for me, so a steep learning curve.
